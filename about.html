    The year was 2012. After browsing Tumblr for hours, 12-year-old me decided to try and dive into the world of HTML and CSS, which was a hobbie for many young girls at the time. I didn't know what IT was - I didn't even know exactly what I was doing with all that code in front of me initially. But I loved to develop webpages and that's what I did for most of my teenage years, creating user-focused websites for other Tumblr and Blogspot enthusiasts and sharing tools so they could develop their own websites!
    
    <br>

    Life led me to a very different path and at the age of 17, I decided to go to Law School, where I learned many skills and abilities that I take into my everyday life: how to communicate, analyse complex situations and solve a variety of problems, assess risks and manage projects.
    
    <br>

    Then, at the age of 22, I passed the bar, graduated and another very different path was put ahead of me: moving to Ireland from Brazil, speaking a second language and starting to study Computing, which I realised has always been my passion!<br>
    
    Would you like to join me on this exciting journey?
